# Real-time-Gesture-Tracking-in-Whac-A-Mole
How to play?
1. Run code/Game.m to start playing.
2. Keep your fist in the bounding box for 2 seconds to start tracking.
3. Move your fist in front of the camera and the visual fist will move accordingly..
4. Open your hand and make a fist again to catch the rat.
5. When tracking fails, keep your fist in the bounding box for 2 seconds to start again.

Some tips:
1. Keep the background pure for convenience of tracking.
2. Don't move too fast, LKT cannot work when two bounding boxes do not overlap.
